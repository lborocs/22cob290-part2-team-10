## TODO

TODO at some point (not feedback from client):

- [x] Store logged in user using cookies
- [ ] Move template CSS & JS to 1 file which get imported into all pages to repeat less
- [ ] Convert template from Bootstrap 4 to 5 (@lisimba8 ðŸ˜ )
  - [x] Already done for `profile`
- [ ] Move hardcoded values from JS to PHP backend (not that much)
  - [ ] I think this is only needed for staff assignment page
- [ ] Theme switching
