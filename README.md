## TODO

TODO at some point ideally:

- [ ] Move template CSS & JS to 1 file which get imported into all pages to repeat less
- [ ] Convert template from Bootstrap 4 to 5 (@lisimba8 😠)
- [ ] Move hardcoded values from JS to PHP backend (not that much)
- [ ] Theme switching
- [ ] Store logged in user in localStorage (but then how would the PHP page know? - figure that out later)
