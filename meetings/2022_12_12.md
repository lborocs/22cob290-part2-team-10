# 12/12/22 Meeting Points

- [x] Explain how Make-It-All is actually structured
  - Company-wide roles: manager, everyone is an employee
  - Project-specific roles: team leader, employee (someone that is assigned tasks)
  - Projects don't get assigned members: tasks are created and the task assignee is then added to the project
    once an employee no longer has any "active" (what they said on forum, waiting for clarification - could be
    if all tasks are completed) tasks, they cannot see the project, i.e. they are no longer on the project

- [x] They want forum posts to be editable by author and managers
  - Would also like to be able to see a post's changes but not a "high priority" for them, but "good to know" who did
    last change

- [x] Finalise pages FIRST
- THEN redistribute them between people

- prisma
  - [x] Explain what it is (ORM, type safety, dont have to write SQL etc.)
    - Using SQLite for development but will use MySQL later
    - To switch to MySQL, pretty much won't have to change anytime - prisma will handle it for us
  - [x] show example (`/forum/author`)
  - [x] Finalise models
  - [x] Model for user's TODO list

- Explain `pnpm`
  - alternative package manager to npm
  - faster installation & uses less space
- Explain `ESLint`

- Go through libraries (in README)

- [x] Explain top level files & directories (under `/prototype_nextjs`)
  - Don't include Docker stuff?

- [x] Explain how we need to write the pages
  - Show template
  - Show sidebar examples
    - Explain that the `layout` prop needs to be defined in order to use our layout
      - Explain `AppPage` type - reasoning for it (helps with typing)
    - Explain how the custom sidebar will work - why it's not that easy to synchronize content between the page & sidebar
      - Because it's not the same component
      - So will need to use `zustand` (explain what zustand is)

- Explain that pages are basically self contained
  - Write components for ur page under `/components/[pagename]/`
  - If using `/lib`, there should be no reason for you to edit/remove stuff from the files, only adding
  - Styles are contained to the page through CSS modules
